# DOT_buoys

## Current Understanding of Project
* Compare DOT drifting buoy sea surface height measurements to those eastimated by ICESat-2.

* This effort is part of the Oceans Melting Greenland [OMG](https://omg.jpl.nasa.gov/portal/) project. OMG seeks to better
estimate sea level rise, by determining "To what extent are the oceans melting Greenlandâ€™s ice from below?"
